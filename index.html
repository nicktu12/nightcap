        A place to decompress through the art of DJing. Open decks every
        Thursday with mainstays and up and comers alike spinning house, techno,
        disco, breaks, and beyond.
      </p>
      <h2>Open Decks</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for your interest in Nightcap at Fort Greene. Please keep in mind that time slots for open decks vary week to week and
        are not guaranteed, previous DJ experience is required. The chalkboard for signup will become available between 4:30 - 5:00 once the booth has been setup. if you haven’t
        played at nightcap before, please reach us via facebook and send us a link to your mix. If this isn't an option please introduce yourself at one of our events.
      </p>
      <p>
        practice on your time, demonstrate your skill on ours. djs should be able to provide a clean, beat-matched, phrased, and unbroken mix for up to 30 minutes without issue. Please don't sign up for a time slot without meeting these requirements.
      </p>
      <h3>Rules</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          No drinks on the dj booth table, there will always be a separate table for drinks
        </li>
        <li>Respect the time slot (up to 30 minutes) - allow the next dj to plug in at least a few minutes before the start of their slot so they can mix in on time, don't hog the decks</li>
        <li>Practice good DJ etiquette and respect for others in the booth</li>
        <li>
          Your first track you mix in should mix with the previous DJ’s final track
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid hard cutting the mix, the goal is to have a seamless night of music with
          no silence during transitions
        </li>
        <li>Treat the decks and mixer with respect</li>
        <li>
          Do not redline, if the channel faders or master volume show red you are mixing too loud
        </li>
        <li>
          Only one person on the decks at a time unless playing b2b  
        </li>
        <li>
          Be aware of the booth volume, it should always be lower than the main mix volume (mix 1 or mix 2)
        </li>
        <li>
          Bring your unique vibe, but also please play appropriately to the room
          and the crowd. Avoid playing peak hour techno if it's still light out and only the bartender and a neighborhood dog are hanging out.
